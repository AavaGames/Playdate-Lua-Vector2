# Playdate-Lua-Vector2
Made by Hasnain Raza
Additions by Philip Fertsman (@aavagames)
	
	Addon to Hasnain's Vector2 lua class for the Playdate. 
	Additions: Clamp, Lerp, Convienance "Vector2.Zero()"
	

	Note: It is recommended that you rely on arithmetic operators rather than calling functions
	because error handling is done primarily on the operators.
